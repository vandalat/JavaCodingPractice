/*
 * Binary Search:
 *
 * Binary search is a search algorithm that works on a sorted array. It compares the target value with the middle element of the array.
 * If the target value is equal to the middle element, the search is complete.
 * If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues on the left half of the array.
 * If the target value is greater than the middle element, the search continues on the right half of the array.
