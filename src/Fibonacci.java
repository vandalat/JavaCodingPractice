/*
 * Implement a program that generates the first N numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
 *
 * The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.
 *
 * For example, the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.
